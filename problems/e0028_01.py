Number spiral diagonals

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5
by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25
20  7  8  9 10
19 Â 6  1  2 11
18  5  4  3 12
17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.  What
is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in
the same way?
